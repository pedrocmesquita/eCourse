# eCourse

# Introdução: 

In this semester, we were challenged to make a program for Learning Systems, an IT company specialized the development of learning solutions.
Our objective was to develop a remove learning platform called eCourse, using a MVP approach.

The system has a authentication and authorization for all its users and functionality and was mainly coded in Java

## Exams

Our platform supports a fully automated approach for exams and evaluation. Teachers of said school will be able to design exams with access to simple and intuitive language and students can take this exams and automatically have feedback and grades right after submitting them.
The platform also presents dashboards about exam results to both students and teachers.

To do this, we specified the exams according with a grammar for exams that is used to validate its specification, following LPROG’s requirements.
This was done using the ANTLR.

More on this topic, our application also aims for students to be able to list all the exams that they took and for a teacher to be able to display all the exams of a course.

## Shared Boards

This is one of the tools that can be used to share and organize ideas and data, most important for the managing of project and can be created by all the users.
Our project aims to allow the validation of main ideas on a board and for a user to be able to create a board, share it with whoever he wants, create post-its and change them however they like, as well as view board history and archive said board.

## Meetings

Meetings are also a functionality of our program: any user has the ability to schedule a meeting and choose the participants they wish to attend it, cancel it, accept/reject invitations and list all of the participants and their response status.
